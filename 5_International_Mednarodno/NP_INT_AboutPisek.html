	<h1>What is Pišek?</h1>
	<p> Pišek /Chick/ is an innovative platform that was established in 2018 with a profound vision: 
	to provide Slovenian schools with an environment where beginners can easily dive into the world of 
	programming and take their first steps with confidence. Inspired by the success of the  
	Projekt TOMO portal, which offers automated feedback on Python programming solutions, we knew we wanted
	Pišek to be just as remarkable. Through extensive research and in consultation with our colleagues 
	from France, who showcased a similar system, we  selected Blockly as our
	programming language of choice. Blockly not only empowers users to explore programming 
	effortlessly but also enables us to offer an array of programming blocks to unleash creativity.
    </p>
	<p>Pišek encompasses two components:
	<ul>
        <li>First, we have a curated collection of exercises and a user-friendly learning environment that 
		introduces students to fundamental algorithmic concepts using programming blocks. 
		This fosters a solid foundation in programming, equipping learners with essential skills 
		for their digital future.
		</li>
        <li>Secondly, we proudly present Pišek Programming Competition, an  platform designed to nurture 
		algorithmic thinking among elementary and secondary school students. This competition stimulates 
		their problem-solving abilities and hones their programming skills through exciting challenges.
		</li>
	</ul>
    <p>To cater to organizational and technical requirements, the Pišek portal currently operates on two systems. 
	The first is <a href = "https://pisek-novi.acm.si/">pisek-novi.acm.si</a> [the system you are currently using],
	a testing platform where we experiment 
	with new methodologies, craft fresh exercises, and explore innovative approaches. 
	Although in its alpha version, we couldn't contain our excitement and decided to open it to the public, 
	embracing the valuable feedback of our users. Our ultimate plan is for this system to evolve 
	into the primary platform.
    </p>
	<p>Simultaneously, we have the proven and reliable <a href = "https://pisek.acm.si/">pisek.acm.si</a>, the original 
	system that has hosted competitions 
	with resounding success. Recognizing the importance of continuity, we have revitalized this system 
	with new exercises as part of our ongoing projects in the first half of 2023.
    </p> 
	<p>The Pišek platform stands on the foundation of the French <a href="http://algorea.org/" target="_blank">
	Algoréa system</a> and embraces the block-based
	programming language Blockly, opening doors to limitless possibilities and fostering a passion for coding.
	</p>
    <p>Join us on this exciting journey as we revolutionize programming education, empowering students to become future 
	innovators and creators. Together, let's unlock the extraordinary potential within each learner and inspire 
	a generation of programming enthusiasts.
